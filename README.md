# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
This project was made for the course of Introduction to Machine Learning. It is based on the various concepts of Machine Learning taught to us during our course.
The objective was to build a machine learning model which takes attributes such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others and predict whether a customer is eligible for the loan or not. 
The following are the steps carried out in evaluating the performance of different Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict the Loan Eligibility:
 1. Pre-Processing
 2. Training Random Forest, Logistic Regression,SVM, AdaBoost, XGBoost Models
 3. Testing the models and obtaining accuracy, precision, recall and f-score
 4. Performing Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
 5. Training Random Forest, Logistic Regression,SVM, AdaBoost, XGBoost Models
 on the reduced dimension data
 6. Testing the models and obtaining accuracy, precision, recall and f-score
 7. Compare the results and find the model with best accuracy for Loan Eligibility Prediction
 
 The data set named "Loan Eligible Dataset" for this project is obtained from Kaggle. Thelink to access the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/loan-eligible-dataset?resource=download
